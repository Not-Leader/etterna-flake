# etterna-flake
a very bad etterna flake because there's no nix package atm
## not very FAQ
### why is this using the develop branch?
because the release doesn't work atm and https://github.com/etternagame/etterna/pull/1282 fixes it
### why is it saying everything's read only
because i don't know how to write a wrapper and set the right envars (see https://github.com/etternagame/etterna/pull/1282 for that but worded better)
